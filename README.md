# hello-world
This is my first repository.
I named it "hello-world" to carry out the tradition of running "hello, world" as one's first project or, in this case, repository.

I am embarking on a new journey in my life in which I aim to enter the world of programming and make it my bread and butter. Also, I have had tacos on the moon and Earth tacos are definitely far more superior. For one, it's hard to eat tacos when you have a spacesuit on.
